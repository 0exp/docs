Redis provides a number of APIs for developers and operators as described in the following document.


## APIs for Developers

You can extend Redis functionality to rapidly implement new commands using the Redis Modules system and API. 

- [Redis Modules API introduction](/docs//develop/reference/modules/)
- [Redis Modules API reference](/docs/develop/reference/modules/modules-api-ref/)

You can upload and use Lua scripts on the Redis server to efficiently read and write data from scripts. Scripts are run with the Lua 5.1 interpreter.

- [Redis Lua API reference](/docs/develop/interact/programmability/lua-api/)
- [Scripting with Lua introduction](/docs/develop/interact/programmability/eval-intro/)

You can run JavaScript functions inside Redis by using Redis Stack triggers and functions.

- [Triggers and functions introduction](/docs/develop/interact/programmability/triggers-and-functions/)
- [Triggers and functions Javascript API reference](/docs/develop/interact/programmability/triggers-and-functions/concepts/javascript_api/)

You can connect your application to a Redis database using a supported Redis client.

- [Connect with Redis clients introduction](/docs/develop/connect/clients/)
- [List of links to clients and associated guides](https://redis.io/resources/clients/)


## Operators

If you have installed Redis Enterprise Software, you can automate operations with the Redis Enterprise REST API.

- [Redis Enterprise Software REST API introduction](/docs/operator/rc/api/)
- [Redis Enterprise Software REST API requests](/docs/operator/rs/references/rest-api/requests/)
- [Redis Enterprise Software REST API objects](/docs/operator/rs/references/rest-api/objects/)

If you have a Redis Cloud subscription, you can programmatically manage your databases, accounts, access, and credentials using the Redis Cloud REST API.

- [Redis Cloud REST API introduction](/docs/operator/rc/api/)
- [Redis Cloud REST API examples](/docs/operator/rc/api/examples/)
- [Redis Cloud REST API reference](/docs/operator/rs/references/rest-api/)
