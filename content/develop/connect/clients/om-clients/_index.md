Redis OM (pronounced *REDiss OHM*) is a library that provides object mapping for Redis. With the help of Redis OM, you can map Redis data types, specifically Hashes and JSON documents, to objects of your preferred programming language or framework. Redis OM relies on Redis Stack's JSON, query, and search features, allowing you to query and search for objects. 

You can use Redis OM with the following four programming languages:

* [Node.js](/docs/connect/clients/om-clients/stack-node/)
* [Python](/docs/connect/clients/om-clients/stack-python/)
* [C# | .NET](/docs/connect/clients/om-clients/stack-dotnet/)
* [Java | Spring](/docs/connect/clients/om-clients/stack-spring/)
