You can install both [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/about/) or [Redis Stack](/operate/oss_and_stack/about/about-stack) locally on your machine. Redis and Redis Stack are available on Linux, macOS, and Windows. 

Here are the installation instructions:

* [Install Redis](/operate/oss_and_stack/install/install-redis)
* [Install Redis Stack](/operate/oss_and_stack/install/install-stack)

While you can install Redis (Stack) locally, you might also consider using Redis Cloud by creating a [free account](https://redis.com/try-free/?utm_source=redisio&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=2023-09-try_free&utm_content=cu-redis_cloud_users).
