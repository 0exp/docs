Use a Redis client like `redis-cli` to send commands to the RedisGears JVM plugin.

## JVM plugin commands



See the general [RedisGears commands](https://oss.redis.com/redisgears/commands.html) page for more commands.

{{<note>}}
Ignore any commands that start with `RG.PY` while using the JVM plugin. The `RG.PY` commands are for the Python plugin.
