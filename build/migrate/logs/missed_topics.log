operate/rs/references/clustering-redis.md:There are several solutions to clustering Redis, most notable of which is the [open source Redis cluster](http://redis.io/topics/cluster-spec).
operate/rs/networking/cluster-dns.md:By default, Redis Enterprise Software deployments use DNS to communicate between nodes.  You can also use the [Discovery Service]({{< relref "/operate/rs/databases/durability-ha/discovery-service.md" >}}), which uses IP addresses to connect and complies with the [Redis Sentinel API](https://redis.io/topics/sentinel) supported by open source Redis.
